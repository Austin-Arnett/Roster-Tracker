# Roster Tracker
Roster Tracker is a small application built in Python with PyQt to help my wife keep track of where each of her students are learning from during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. With students switching back and forth between remote and in-person learning, it quickly became difficult for her to know if a student was "present" that day.

The roster of students can be filtered by class period or student status. Each class period's roster can also be exported to a .CSV file for sending in to administration for attendance.

This test version uses a fake csv file stored in a Github repository to store the "student" data. The production version uses a file stored locally on her school computer to prevent any FERPA violations.
